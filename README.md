Wrangling_MangoDB
=================

In this project I explore wrangling data from diverse sources and shape so to enable data-driven applications. 
I show examples how to gather and extract data from widely used data formats, assess the quality of data and 
explore some practices for data cleaning. In addition to that I will cover the essentials of storing data and the
MongoDB query language together with exploratory analysis using the MongoDB aggregation framework.
